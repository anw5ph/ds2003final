# DS 2003 Final: NYPD Shooting Incidents

## Introduction / Abstract

Gun violence is a prominent issue continuously affecting the lives of millions nationwide.  Despite having some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, guns are the third-leading cause of death for children and teenagers in New York.  On average, New York gun homicides take the lives of 402 people while gun assaults wound 1,522 each year (Everytown, 2022).  Although gun violence continues to prevail, one can determine indicators that increase the likelihood of a shooting incident so that preventative action can be taken.  Throughout this project, we hope to explore the nature of police enforcement activity by creating interactive data visualizations that will identify factors predicting shooting incidents while analyzing the distribution of shootings across New York. We also hope to investigate potential causes for any trends found by looking at broader socioeconomic and educational issues in New York. 

## Dataset Summary 

```{r}

nypd <- read_csv("nypd_shootings.csv")

```

For our final project, we chose to use a kaggle dataset titled “NYPD Shooting Incident Data” and “Data Science for Good: PASSNYC.”

### Data {.tabset}

#### NYPD Shooting Incident Data

The NYPD Shooting Incident dataset contains a breakdown of every shooting incident in New York City in 2022. The dataset contains 26 columns including details about location, time, victim demographics, and perpetrator demographics with each record representing an individual incident. Analyses performed on this dataset will allow us to determine patterns in crime across New York City. 

For our final, we will be using 6 columns, but information on the other 20 columns is still relevant in providing adequate context about our dataset.  Below we quickly summarize the 20 columns that will not be used before providing deeper discussion on the 6 variables used in this report. 

The following variables are included in the NYPD Shooting Incident dataset but will not be examined or discussed in our analysis: incident key, description of location (outside vs inside), precinct, jurisdiction code, location classification, location description (further descriptives about the location), murder flag, perpetrator age, perpetrator race, victim age, victim sex, victim race, x coordinate, y coordinate, georeference point, borough boundaries, city council district, police precinct, zip code, and community district. The following variables, as described below, will be utilized in our analysis. Visualizations providing deeper insights into the variables can be found at the end of the document.


* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **OCCUR_DATE** </span>: This column contains the date, in character format, that each shooting incident occurred. Dates range from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2022. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **OCCUR_DATE_CLEAN** </span>: This column contains the date, in date time format, that each shooting incident occurred. Dates range from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2022. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **OCCUR_TIME_HOUR** </span>: This column tells us the hour, in numeric format, at which the shooting incident occurred. Hours range from 0 to 24. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **PERP_SEX** </span>: This column tells us the sex description of the perpetrator of the shooting. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **BORO** </span>: This column tells us the borough in which the shooting occurred. Boroughs include the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Latitude** </span>: The latitude column provides the latitude coordinate, in decimal degrees, at which the incident occurred. Values range from 40.5 to 40.9 and are reported in numeric format. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Longitude** </span>: The longitude column provides the longitude coordinate, in decimal degrees, at which the incident occurred. Values range from -74.2 to -73.7 and are reported in numeric format. 

#### Data Science for Good: PASSNYC

The PASSNYC dataset contains information about 1272 public schools in New York City. The data is from 2016, but the columns we have chosen to examine provide statistics that are unlikely to show significant change over 6 years. Thus, we can effectively analyze these numbers in the context of 2022 shooting incident data. There are 161 columns that provide detailed information about each school’s location, demographics and student performance as well as a few economic indicators. For our second question, we will be using 7 columns, which are listed and summarized below. The remaining columns are not pertinent to our analysis, so further information on these columns will not be provided. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **City** </span>: This column contains the region in which the school is located. Values include each of the five boroughs as well as several specific neighborhoods throughout New York City. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Economic Need Index** </span>: This column provides the Economic Need Index for each school. This index measures the socioeconomic circumstances of the school’s student body. Values are reported in character format, so for analysis purposes, we converted them to numeric format. They range from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting greater need, or worse circumstances. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Effective School Leadership Rating** </span>: This column tells us how well school leadership inspires the school community with a clear instructional vision and effectively distributes leadership to realize this vision, Rates are given as categorical classifications of "Not Meeting Target", "Approaching Target", "Meeting Target", "Exceeding Target" which we have converted to "Low", "Medium", "High", and "Very High."

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Strong Family-Community Ties Rating** </span>: This column tells us how well the school forms effective partnerships with families to improve the school. Rates are given as categorical classifications of "Not Meeting Target", "Approaching Target", "Meeting Target", "Exceeding Target" which we have converted to "Low", "Medium", "High", and "Very High."

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Borough** </span>: This column containers the borough in which the school is located. We added this column by matching each neighborhood in the City column to its corresponding borough.

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Latitude** </span>: The latitude column provides the latitude coordinate, in decimal degrees, at which the incident occurred. Values range from 40.5 to 40.9 and are reported in numeric format. 

* <span style="color: #FAA0A0"> **Longitude** </span>: The longitude column provides the longitude coordinate, in decimal degrees, at which the incident occurred. Values range from -74.2 to -73.7 and are reported in numeric format. 


## Question 1

### Question

### Discussion 

Looking at all NYPD shooting incidents in New York City in 2022 by borough, we see that shooting incidents mainly occurred in the upper part of Manhattan, Bronx, and in Brooklyn. Breaking this down by sex, when perpetrators were female, the density of shootings in these areas were less severe, indicating that the majority of perpetrators were male. These findings are not surprising as men are more likely to externalize their anger and 98% of all U.S. mass shootings have been conducted by males (Martin, 2021).  To gain a better understanding of shooting rates by perpetrator sex, we will analyze the density of incidents by time and month. 
  
To determine if a relationship between the number of shooting incidents and time of incident exists, we decided to break down the 24 hours in a day into four sections.  Early mornings were considered as hours 0 through 6, morning as hours 6 through 12, afternoon as hours 12 through 18, and night as hours 18 through 24. Looking at male perpetrators, two distinct clusters of shootings are seen in the Bronx and Brooklyn across all hours.  Shootings were always higher in the Bronx than Brooklyn, and a majority of incidents occurred in the early mornings and nights; reduced clustering is seen in the morning and afternoon.  This finding matches those of other major cities as, violent crime, which includes murder, rape/sexual assault, weapons related incidences, and burglary, tend to occur at night between 7 p.m. and 6:59 a.m. for 10 of the most populus U.S. cities (Favre, 2019).  For female perpetrators, the density of shooting incidents in the early morning was heavily concentrated along the border between Manhattan and the Bronx with some smaller clustering in northern Brooklyn.  This trend continues through the morning and afternoon.  However, in metropolitan areas, weapons-related incidents tend to peak during 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., which could explain why a significant increase in shootings was seen during night hours by female perpetrators (“When…”, 2023). 
  
Across different months of the year, a distinct cluster of incidents conducted by female perpetrators exists around Manhattan and the Bronx.  However, for male perpetrators, there is a distinct cluster of incidents in Brooklyn and another clear cluster in Bronx/Manhattan. Throughout the whole year, the cluster in Bronx/Manhattan is always fairly distinct.  In contrast, clustering in Brooklyn tends to fade in spring before becoming prominent again in the summer and fall. 
  
In New York, five police precincts made of low-income neighborhoods contained nearly a quarter of all shooting incidents and homicides (Akinnibi, 2022). These precincts are located in Brooklyn and the Bronx, which contained the most defined clusters for both males and females throughout the whole year with clusters being most distinct in the early morning as well as during the afternoon.  During these time periods, clear boundaries exist between the most dense clusters, and these clusters have centers with notably higher densities than the surrounding areas. When looking at incidents perpetrated by both males and females during different times of the year, the dense cluster of incidents in Brooklyn almost dissipates during November and December; in contrast with the high density observed in this region in prior months, the cluster appears less prominent and more spread out. This lower density may be attributed to additional efforts employed by the NYPD during these months to “combat gun violence in neighborhoods across the city” (“NYPD…”, 2023). 

## Question 2

### Question
Using the results discovered in question 1, is there a relationship between the boroughs with the highest shooting rates in terms of public school education quality or economic status?

### Discussion

As was previously discussed in question one, the two boroughs with the highest shooting rates by a significant margin are the Bronx and Brooklyn. There are countless variables that can be linked to why shootings are more likely to occur in certain areas over others, but we are going to focus primarily on societal shortcomings that could be linked to the increased gun violence in these areas.

Beginning with financial instability, of the five boroughs in New York, The Bronx, and Brooklyn are the two with the lowest median household incomes from the years 2017 to 2021. According to the Census Bureau, Staten Island, and Manhattan are sitting just around the $90,000 a year mark, with Queens just over $75,000 a year. This number falls nearly another $10,000 a year for Brooklyn and has a staggering drop to $43,000 a year for The Bronx. In a similar fashion, The Bronx and Brooklyn also lead the boroughs in terms of the percentage of citizens living in poverty, with 26.4% and 19.2% respectively. These numbers are substantially lower for the other boroughs. These issues with finances can be a great catalyst for crimes that can easily lead to gun crimes. As will be shown in an example below, there is nearly a direct correlation between the number of robberies and shootings in the areas. Here is a table indicating the number of robberies for each borough in the year 2022 (data retrieved from NYC.gov, and collected by the NYPD).

<center>
![Table depicting number of robberies for a given borough.](table.png)
</center>

Another potential reason could be the link between the high school graduation rates of adults and gun violence. The correlation is not as strong as the link between finances and lesser crimes, however, there is still a notable difference between the boroughs. For example, Staten Island and Manhattan both have high school graduation rates of over 88% in 2022, however, this number falls to 74.1% and 83.7% for The Bronx and Brooklyn respectively. The only slight deviation is that Queens is lower than Brooklyn, at 82.7%, but this could in part be due to Queen’s having a higher percentage of persons over the age of 65, who are significantly less likely to have graduated from high school in the mid-late 1900s, according to New York University. Additionally, this demographic is less likely to have been involved in gun violence, according to the dataset we have been examining throughout this project. Another potential reason for lower high school graduation rates in these boroughs is from the high presence of gangs in these areas.

The paragraphs leading up to this point have been discussing similarities between these boroughs and how they have higher rates of gun violence compared to the other three boroughs. However, the most significant factor contributing to this trend is gang activity. According to the Brownster in 2016, Brooklyn accounts for 35% of all of New York’s gangs, bringing the total in the borough to 135. This number is bound to have changed in the following years, but not by extreme margins. Additionally, an article by the New York Times lists the primary locations of many of the most well-known gangs in New York City. The Bronx and Brooklyn are mentioned countless times, whereas locations in Queens and Manhattan are much less frequent. A more recent article written in 2022 by ABC7 News describes how the amount of violent crime has been increasing in New York, particularly in The Bronx, and the NYPD believes this is in large part due to gang activity and narcotic sales.


## Conclusion

  Recent reports regarding gun violence in the United States have confirmed definitively that the nation is dealing with a large scale, indisputable problem. Despite the US’s classification as a high income, industrialized society, cities nationwide are still plagued by rates of gun violence that far exceed those of other nations with similar socioeconomic standings. New York City is of particular interest when analyzing patterns of violent crime, as it is one of the most densely populated regions in the country and is often a focal point of discourse regarding gun control. An epicenter for commerce and a home to millions, New York plays a major role in the functioning and identity of the United States; thus, it is of utmost importance to devote time and resources to identifying patterns of crime here, as findings may ultimately inform legislative decisions and guide law enforcement agents in their efforts to prevent future incidents. By examining geographical changes in incident density over time, we were able to deduce trends that occurred over the course of 2022 as well as trends that were dependent upon the time of day and/or sex of the perpetrator. Our results can be used to glean insights into factors that may underlie fluctuations in shooting rates and to inform law enforcement of regions and time frames that are typically associated with the most shootings. Our analysis went beyond the scope of simply determining when and where shootings typically occurred in 2022; our use of precise location (latitude and longitude) in generating the heat maps allowed us to unveil subtle changes in incidence related to perpetrator sex, time of day and time of year. Moving from our first inquiry into our second, we were interested in investigating factors that could be related to our initial findings and decided to look into the quality of public education and economic status across boroughs in New York. _____________.  For as long as gun violence continues to devastate communities throughout the country, analyses like our own will remain paramount in efforts to identify risks and reduce the number of firearm-related deaths.

### Chart & Widget Justification for Question 1

  In the beginning we were interested in using maps for our question and we decided that a simple map with points to represent each shooting incident would not be sufficient enough because they points would become overwhelming and block out key pieces of data. Therefore, we decided to transition into a density heat map. We believe that this is the appropriate chart for our data because we are studying the rate of shooting incidents in New York City so it would be best to of course plot that data on a map and be able to visually see through color encoding which boroughs have the highest density of shootings. Additionally, we decided to have widgets that can adjust the sex of the perpetrator in order to see if there was any relationship between that and a particualar borough or boroughs. Alongside perpetrator sex, we decided to have a widget that allows us to adjust the time of day. This is useful because there does seem to be certain times of day that certain boroughs are more prevalent to shootings than others. Hinting at a possible relationship between the two. Finally, we added a widget that allows the user to filter by a specific date range. Our reasoning behind this is that at different times of the year there may be certain boroughs that spike in their rate of shooting incidents and dip other times of the year. With that being said, we believe the density-based heat map and the three widgets chosen are perfect for exploring our question of which boroughs may experience the highest rate of shooting incidents throughout 2022. 

### Chart & Widget Justification for Question 2

  Similar to question 1, we were interested in using maps for our question and we decided that a simple map with points to represent each shooting incident would not be sufficient enough because they points would become overwhelming and block out key pieces of data. Therefore, we decided to transition into a density heat map. We believe that this is the appropriate chart for our data because we are studying the rate of shooting incidents in the Bronx and Brooklyn, so it would be best to of course plot that data on a map and be able to visually see through color the density of shootings in each borough. Additionally, we decided to have widgets that can adjust the sex of the perpetrator in order to see if there was any relationship between that and a particualar borough. Alongside perpetrator sex, we decided to have a widget that allows us to adjust the time of day. This is useful because there does seem to be certain times of day that certain boroughs are more prevalent to shootings than others. Hinting at a possible relationship between the two. Finally, we added a widget that allows the user to filter by a specific date range. Our reasoning behind this is that at different times of the year there may be certain boroughs that spike in their rate of shooting incidents and dip other times of the year. With that being said, we believe the density-based heat map and the three widgets chosen are perfect for exploring our question of if there is a relationship between the two boroughs with the highest rate of shootings and the borough itself.
